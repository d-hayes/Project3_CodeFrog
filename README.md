# Project3_CodeFrog

Instrcutions: 
This is a group project. You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.

The following are required elements of the final script(s) that are turned in:

You must have a database with at least 2 tables
Each table should have a primary key 
There should be at least one foreign key
You can either set up the tables in sqlite or from your Python script.
Your Python script should use SQLAlchemy to
Add data to the database
Query data in the database using each of these commands:
select, where, join
Preferably uses the SQL Expression Language, but OK if you use raw SQL.
 

You may choose one of the following for what your script does as long as it meas the above criteria.

Write a script to analyze the flight data from PS2. You can choose what you want to analyze, or ask for help if you can't think of anything.

Write a script that does anything of your choice. This is kind of wide open, but remember the criteria above. Each of those criteria must be satisfied in your script for full points.
