class project of the Idigbio dataset

Description:
The dataset came from the iDigBio portal search. Our search parameters were specificed as follows: Alachua County, Florida, PreservedSpecimens (to exclude fossils), Phylum Chordata.

Tables:
Table 1 describes taxonomy (genus, family, class, order) of Alachua County, Florida chordates. Table 2 describes data from individual specimens collected from Alachua Country, Florida (including institution information and collection date). There is a one-to-many relationship: a single genus (or family,class, order) in table 1 can be linked to many specimens in table 2, but a single specimen in table 2 can be linked to only one genus (and family,class, order).
